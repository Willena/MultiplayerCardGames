        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
        Players take turns playing a single card onto the play deck. A valid play consists of:<br>
        - matching suit<br>
        - matching rank (number)<br>
        - an 8<br><br>
        If an 8 is played, a suit is chosen which the next player must play. An 8 is always a valid play.<br><br>
        If there is no valid play, cards are drawn until a valid play becomes available.<br><br>
        Cards may be drawn at any time, even if a valid play is available.
        <h4>Winning</h4>
        The first player to empty their hand wins!
